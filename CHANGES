1.2.1
 - Adding few fixes to make jshint happy.
 - Fix for issue #12, function expressions can cause scoping issues in IE.
 - NPM will minify on install or when `npm run-script install` is executed.
 - Adding .gitignore to avoid publishing dev dependencies.

1.2.0
 - Making script loadable as AMD module.
 - Adding `indexOf` to the list of safe shims.

1.1.0
 - Added support for accessor properties where possible (which is all browsers
   except IE).
 - Stop exposing bound function's (that are returned by
   `Function.prototype.bind`) internal properties (`bound, boundTo, boundArgs`)
   as in some cases (when using facade objects for example) capabilities of the
   enclosed functions will be leaked.
 - `Object.create` now explicitly sets `__proto__` property to guarantee
   correct behavior of `Object.getPrototypeOf`'s on all objects created using
   `Object.create`.
 - Switched to `===` from `==` where possible as it's slightly faster on older
   browsers that are target of this lib.
 - Added names to all anonymous functions to have a better stack traces.

1.0.0

   http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=6120#986
